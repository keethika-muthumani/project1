          Avoid Trigger Foods: Some foods may exacerbate inflammation and worsen

            </li>
            <li>
              Nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, eggplants, peppers) â€“ some people
              find these worsen
            </li>
            <li>symptoms, though research is inconclusive.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider Allergens: Some individuals with RA may have food

        </li>
        Always remember that while diet can play a supportive role in managing
        RA symptoms, it<br />
        should complement, not replace, medical treatment prescribed by
        healthcare professionals

          disease actvity.
