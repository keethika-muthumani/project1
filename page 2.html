    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect
        more than just your joints.</li><br>
      <li>In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems,
        including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.<br>
        An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune
        system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues</li><br>
      <li> Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis
        affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that<br>
        can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity.</li><br>
      <li> The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage
        other parts of the body as well.</li><br>
      <li>While new types of medications have improved treatment options
        dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical
        disabilities.</li><br>
      <li>There are many types of arthritis, but one thing they all have in common is that they can cause pain,
        swelling, and stiffness in the joints. </li><br>
      <li>Arthritis can be caused by injury, wear and tear, or an autoimmune disease. </li><br>
      <li>There are more than 100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods. </li><br>
      <li>Some types of arthritis can affect other parts of the body, such as the skin, eyes, and lungs. </li><br>
      <li>Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent long-term damage to the joints. </li><br>
      <li>Arthritis can be a chronic condition, but with the right treatment, most people can manage their symptoms and
        lead a normal life. </li><br>
      <li>There is no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments available to help manage the symptoms. </li><br>
      <li class="pre-heading">Types</li>
      <li>
        <pre>Many rheumatic disorders of chronic, intermittent pain (including joint pain, neck pain or back pain) have historically been caused by infectious diseases. Their etiology was unknown until the 20th century and not treatable. Postinfectious arthritis, also known as reactive arthritis, and rheumatic fever are other examples.

        <li>In the United States, major rheumatic disorders are divided into 10 major categories based on the nomenclature and classification proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 1983.[10]</li>
        
            <li>Diffuse connective tissue diseases</li>

              </ul>
           <li> Miscellaneous disorders associated with articular manifestations</li>
           <ul>
               <li> Palindromic rheumatism is thought to be a form of rheumatoid arthritis.[13]</li>

      <li class="pre-heading">Diagnosis</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood and urine tests will measure levels of creatinine and uric acid to determine kidney function, an
          elevation of the ESR and CRP is possible. After a purine-restricted diet, another urine test will help
          determine
          whether the body is producing too much uric acid or the body isn't excreting enough uric acid. Rheumatoid
          factor
          may be present, especially in the group that is likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. A fine needle is used
          to
          draw fluid from a joint to determine if there is any build-up of fluid. The presence of uric acid crystals in
          the fluid would indicate gout. In many cases there may be no specific test, and it is often a case of
          eliminating other conditions before getting a correct diagnosis. </li>
